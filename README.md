SublimeFoundationSnippets
=========================

Foundation snippets for the Sublime text editor

These snippets were created to increase the speed of production when using Zurb Foundation files when using Sublime Text.

Please let me know if there is anything missing and I will do my best to add thoes snippets into this repo also.

Cheers,
Sam Chalmers
